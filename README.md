##  Game Links Bot

This is a bot written in Go that sends links of games played by members of Chesswahili on Telegram .
Its a remake of [this bot](https://github.com/swahili-chess/community-bot) which i previous wrote in Javascript.
As we all know Javascript comes with weird unknown and unusual errors that leads to bot shutting down, hence it was necessary to rewrite
with a more capable language for the task (Go).

## How it works

The bot monitors games played by members of Chesswahili on lichess and extracts the links of these games. It then sends these links to a specified Telegram Chat with ChesswahiliBot.
